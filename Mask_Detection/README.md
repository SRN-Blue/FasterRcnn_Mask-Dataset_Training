# Face Mask Detection using Faster R-CNN

## Introduction

The integration of computer vision and deep learning has led to significant advancements in object detection tasks, including face mask detection. This project presents an implementation of a Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model using PyTorch for precise face mask detection and classification. Utilizing a custom dataset sourced from Kaggle, the model accurately identifies faces with masks, masks worn incorrectly, and faces without masks. Augmentation techniques via Albumentations and tailored preprocessing pipelines enhance model robustness, ensuring reliable performance across diverse scenarios. This README provides an overview of the dataset, model architecture, training procedures, evaluation metrics, and usage guidelines, showcasing the project's technical capabilities and contributions to object detection tasks. Letâ€™s explore the detailed technical aspects and outcomes of this impactful project.


## Technologies Used

1. **PyTorch**: A deep learning framework that provides a flexible and efficient platform for building and training neural network models.
2. **Faster R-CNN**: A popular two-stage object detection model that combines region proposal networks with a classifier to detect objects with bounding boxes.
3. **Albumentations**: An image augmentation library that offers a wide range of transformations to augment and diversify the training dataset, improving model generalization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Preprocessing Images**:
   - Resize and normalize images to a consistent size suitable for model input.
   - Apply augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments using Albumentations to increase dataset diversity.

2. **Data Format Creation**:
   - Generate annotations with bounding box coordinates and class labels for each image in a format compatible with Faster R-CNN training requirements (e.g., COCO format).

3. **Training the Model**:
   - Implement the Faster R-CNN architecture using PyTorch, including backbone networks (e.g., ResNet) for feature extraction and region proposal networks (RPN) for object detection.
   - Train the model using the annotated dataset, optimizing parameters to minimize detection and classification loss functions.

4. **Evaluation and Results**:
   - Evaluate the trained model using a separate validation/test dataset to calculate performance metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision, Recall, and F1-score for each class.
   - Plot and visualize the evaluation results using tools like Matplotlib to analyze model performance and identify areas for improvement.
